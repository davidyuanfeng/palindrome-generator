## palindrome-generator
This project aims to generate numerical _palindromes_, a positive integer that is the same when its digits are reversed. Ex: 1, 2, 3, 11, 101, 1221.

By the symmetric property of palindromes, they can be generated by concatenating and slicing strings of lesser digit integers, or _base palindromes_.
